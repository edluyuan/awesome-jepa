## What is JEPA?

A Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture predicts the representation of a target signal from the representation of a context signal, entirely in an abstract latent space. Where generative models reconstruct every pixel or token, a JEPA predicts features, so it can discard unpredictable detail and keep the structure that matters for understanding, reasoning, and planning.

A JEPA has three parts: a context encoder, a target encoder, and a predictor that maps context embeddings to predicted target embeddings. Predicting in embedding space admits a trivial solution where everything collapses to a constant, so JEPAs use an asymmetry to prevent this, such as a stop-gradient target encoder updated as an exponential moving average, or an explicit variance and covariance penalty.

This design is the centerpiece of LeCun's proposal for autonomous machine intelligence, where an agent learns a predictive world model in representation space and plans by searching for actions that lead to desired predicted states. The family began with images (I-JEPA) and video (V-JEPA, V-JEPA 2) and now reaches audio, point clouds, graphs, time series, and many scientific domains.
